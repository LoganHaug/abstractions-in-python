# Using the Notebooks on Google Colab

We make the notebooks available in two formats: as `.ipynb` files here on GitHub, and as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebooks. 
Notebooks hosted on GitHub are convenient if all you want to do is passively read them. 
Notebooks hosted on Colab let you play, modify, and experiment with the lecture material. 
You can access them as follows. 

## Using Google Colab for the first time

The first time you click on a link for a notebook hosted on Google Colab, there are two cases.  If you are lucky (which usually means, you have used Colab and forgot you did), the notebook will just open.  More often, you will see a blank screen with an offer to download the file, an a small prompt at the top to "Connect more apps".  Click on that, and search for "colab" or "colaboratory".  You will fin the app; click "connect".  Next time you try to open a link to a notebook in Drive, it will open in Colab. 

## Playing with your own copy of a notebook

To play with a notebook on Colab, you need to make your own copy.  To do so, click on `File > Save a Copy on Drive`.  This will create a copy on which you can work.  Unfortunately, the new copy is always put into a `Colab` folder in your drive; from there, you can move it to the folder you prefer.
